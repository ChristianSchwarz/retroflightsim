"""Bake observed ground cover onto the planet quadtree grid.

Reads an existing ``assets/planet`` tree - the one ``bake_planet_dem.py``
wrote - and, for every ``.pdm`` height tile, resamples the landcover and
imagery rasters onto that tile's own ``size * size`` geographic grid, writing
a matching ``.plc``::

    {z}/{x}/{y}.plc     zlib-compressed PLC1: one class + one sRGB triple
                        per grid node

``tools/bake_planet_mesh.ts`` then reduces those per-node values to one class
and one colour per *facet*, and bakes them into the mesh. This step exists so
that reduction happens against the same grid the heights use, instead of every
mesh bake reprojecting a global raster.

Three rules live here rather than downstream:

* WorldCover's sparse 10..100 codes are compacted to the dense 0..15
  ``TerrainClass`` range the mesh format carries. The map is the one in
  ``src/script/terrain/tones.ts`` and the two must agree.
* Landcover speckle is merged into patches that read at a stated ground
  distance (``--patch-m``); see ``tools/cover_patches.py`` for why that is a
  majority filter and not a region merge. Tiles are read with a halo so the
  result is identical to filtering the whole coverage at once and no seam can
  appear along a tile border.
* Where imagery is missing - no scene, cloud, or no imagery at all - the node
  takes a plausible ground colour for its class instead (``CLASS_COLORS``, not
  ESA's map legend). That keeps every tile fully populated, so the mesh bake
  never has to know which sources were around, and the imagery-driven modes
  degrade to a flat-but-plausible look rather than to grey.

Usage::

    python tools/bake_planet_cover.py
    python tools/bake_planet_cover.py --landcover data/cover/landcover.tif
    python tools/bake_planet_cover.py --max-zoom 10 --only 12/3745/1410
    python tools/bake_planet_cover.py --patch-m 150

With no ``--landcover`` / ``--imagery``, ``data/cover/sources.json`` is used
if ``tools/fetch_cover_sources.py`` has been run.

Requires ``rasterio`` and ``numpy``::

    pip install rasterio numpy
