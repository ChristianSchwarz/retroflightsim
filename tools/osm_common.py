"""Plumbing shared by the OpenStreetMap bake stages.

Two stages now read OSM and the baked planet pyramid — ``bake_osm_coast.py``
for land, water and watercourses, ``bake_osm_airports.py`` for aerodromes —
and they need the same things: a tile grid, an Overpass client, the element
helpers that survive Overpass's ``out body; >; out skel qt;`` answer shape, and
readers for the ``.pdm`` heights and ``.lwm`` land mask already on disk.

Shared rather than copied, because the parts that matter here are the ones a
copy gets subtly wrong. The Overpass cache is keyed by query hash and lives in
one directory: two clients would mean two caches, and a stage re-fetching what
its neighbour already has is exactly what the cache exists to prevent. The tile
snapping is the rule that keeps two imported areas stitched together, and the
way-id de-duplication is a bug that cost a whole peninsula once already.
