"""Combine the coastline land polygon with OSM landuse polygons into one
non-overlapping, tagged partition of a tile.

`bake_osm_coast.py`'s own `.lvr` layer already carries precise land/water
ring geometry; `osm_landuse.py` carries real landuse polygons but only ever
burns them onto a raster (`stamp_landuse_classes`), discarding the vector
overlap-resolution it does along the way. This module does the equivalent
resolution in vector space, scoped to one tile at a time, so the result can
be persisted as rings too (the LVR4 layer in `tools/bake/lvr.ts`) and the
mesh bake can cut real geometry along a landuse edge the same way it already
does along the coast.

Scoped per tile deliberately, not run once globally: a bbox's landuse fetch
routinely assembles tens of thousands of polygons, and an iterative
priority-ordered overlay across all of them at once is a known bad pattern
for GEOS (the cost of each step grows with the accumulated complexity of
everything already claimed). `osm_landuse.py`'s own `stamp_landuse_classes`
already avoids this the same way, with an `STRtree` query scoped to one
tile's bbox - this module does the same query, just resolves the winner
geometrically instead of burning it onto a raster.

    GEOS's overlay engine (difference/intersection/union) can produce a
    technically invalid result even from two valid inputs - rare on any one
    call, but assemble_tile_regions chains hundreds of overlay operations per
    tile in its priority loop, each one's output feeding the next as an
    input, so a numerically degenerate result from one step becomes an
    invalid input to the next. Left unrepaired that does not just produce a
    wrong-but-valid answer - GEOS's own overlay code can throw outright
    ("AssertionFailedException: Unable to determine overlay result geometry
    dimension"), which is what a real Leipzig bake hit once this feature had
    enough real landuse density to exercise a long chain.

    A plain `is_valid` check is not enough to catch this: a `buffer(0)` (or
    `make_valid()`) repair on a genuinely degenerate input can itself come
    back as a `GeometryCollection` mixing a real polygon with a stray line or
    point - a shape shapely considers "valid" (validity is a simple-features
    notion, and a collection can't fail it the way a self-intersecting ring
    does), but one GEOS's overlay code can still choke on once it is fed back
    in as one side of the *next* difference() in the chain. So this always
    reduces to plain polygon area, dropping any lower-dimensional debris,
    rather than trusting `is_valid` alone. `make_valid()` (GEOS's own repair)
    is used ahead of the older `buffer(0)` trick - reproduced on the actual
    Leipzig failure, where `buffer(0)` alone was not sufficient to stop the
    assertion from recurring one step later in the same chain.
