"""Bake OSM land/water coast masks into the planet quadtree pyramid.

Reads an existing ``assets/planet`` tree (manifest + index from DEM bake),
assembles land polygons from OpenStreetMap, rasterises them onto the same
257-node geographic grid as ``.pdm`` tiles, and writes ``.lwm`` files plus a
``coastMask`` block in ``manifest.json``.

Data sources (in priority order):

1. ``--land-shp PATH`` — shapefile from osmcoastline (preferred)
2. ``--pbf PATH`` — run osmcoastline if installed, else parse with Overpass-style logic
3. Overpass API for ``--bbox`` or manifest ``coverage``

Usage::

    python tools/bake_osm_coast.py --manifest assets/planet/manifest.json
    python tools/bake_osm_coast.py --bbox -18.66,26.97,-12.61,30.49 --out assets/planet
    python tools/bake_osm_coast.py --manifest assets/planet/manifest.json --pbf data/canary-islands.osm.pbf

Requires ``shapely`` and ``requests``::

    pip install shapely requests

Optional: ``osmcoastline`` binary for robust coastline assembly from PBF.

    Measured from the body's *perimeter*, one step outside it - not from its
    interior. Both choices were forced by real tiles:

    - The interior is not the water surface. Where a reservoir has dropped
      below its mapped extent the DEM under the polygon is dry canyon; on Lake
      Powell it spans 442 m with no plateau anywhere in it to find.
    - What reads as broken from the air is water standing *above* the ground
      beside it. Land above water is simply a shore. So the height that matters
      is the one the shoreline agrees with, and it has to sit under the lowest
      part of that shore rather than at its average - taking the perimeter
      median leaves half the shoreline leaking.

    A low percentile rather than the minimum, because the minimum is one bad
    DEM sample away from sinking the whole lake: on Powell that is 895 m
    against the 927 m the 5th percentile gives.

    Samples below the sea datum are set aside first. A coastal lagoon tagged
    `natural=water` has open sea along part of its perimeter, and sampling the
    sea floor there dragged the percentile under water: measured on the African
    coast in the Canary bake, 31 bodies came out at up to -49.5 m and one of
    them was 4.9 km across, which is a pit rather than a lagoon.

    Set aside, not clamped, and only when something is left. A lake that genuinely
    sits below sea level - the Dead Sea, the Salton Sea, the Caspian - has a
    perimeter that is below it too, so nothing survives the filter and the raw
    percentile is used. Those are real elevations and must come through intact.
