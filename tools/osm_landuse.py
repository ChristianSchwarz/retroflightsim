"""Fetch OSM natural/landuse polygons and paint them onto the cover class grid.

A separate module from ``bake_planet_cover.py`` because that file is
documented (see its ``_metres_per_degree`` docstring) to depend on rasterio
and numpy only, not shapely. Assembling OSM polygons needs shapely -
``nodes_map``/``ways_map``/``relation_rings`` from ``osm_common.py``, and an
``STRtree`` to find which of many separately-classified polygons owns a given
tile. ``bake_planet_cover.py`` imports this module lazily behind a
``try/except`` (the same shape as ``HAS_RASTERIO`` in ``bake_osm_coast.py``),
so a bake that never passes ``--osm-landuse`` never needs shapely installed.

Modeled on ``bake_osm_coast.py``'s ``overpass_query()``/``_polygons_from_osm``,
reusing ``osm_common.py``'s Overpass client and element helpers rather than
re-implementing the way-id de-dup / relation-ring assembly that already cost
a mis-baked peninsula once (see ``osm_common.ways_map``'s docstring).

Unlike the coastline bake, which folds everything into one land/water union,
every polygon here keeps its own class - this is "which of thousands of
separately-tagged shapes contains this point", not one in/out test. That is
what needs a spatial index (``build_landuse_index``) where the coast bake
gets away without one.
