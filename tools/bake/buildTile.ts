/**
 * Composes one baked tile: DEM heights + OSM polygons in, PTM1 bytes out.
 *
 * Pipeline, in order:
 *   1. classify nodes and locate shoreline crossings   (shoreline.ts)
 *   2. decimate into a restricted quadtree and cut the coast  (decimate.ts),
 *      holding the *padded* heights to a tolerance of their own alongside the
 *      raw DEM's (see padNodeHeights)
 *   3. enforce the triangle budget by coarsening and retrying
 *   4. project grid space -> geodetic -> ECEF -> tile-local scene axes
 *   5. apply the airbase flatten pad, the water surface and the depth bias
 *   6. sample the cover raster per facet, build skirts, split the streams
 *   7. encode                                              (ptm.ts)
 *
 * Everything the output depends on is fixed at build time, which is the whole
 * point: there is no runtime equivalent of this file, and no fallback path.
 *
 * Step 4 lands in *scene* axes, not raw ENU: x = east, y = up, z = **south**.
 * The runtime binds these vertices to the GPU untouched, so the frame they are
 * written in is the frame they are drawn in, and a left-handed one would draw
 * the whole planet as its own mirror image. See `sceneFromEnu` in geodesy.ts.
