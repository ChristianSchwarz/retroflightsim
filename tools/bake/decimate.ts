/**
 * Restricted-quadtree decimation of a tile's height grid.
 *
 * A tile arrives as `size x size` height nodes (so `size - 1` cells per side).
 * We build a quadtree over the cells and merge a block into a single leaf while
 * four conditions hold:
 *
 *   1. the block's heights stay within `maxErrorM` of the bilinear surface
 *      through its four corners,
 *   2. the block does not straddle a region boundary - the shoreline, a real
 *      landuse edge, or both at once, wherever they cross the same cell,
 *   3. the same holds of the *padded* heights, against a tolerance the
 *      triangle budget is not allowed to relax - see `padHeights`, and
 *   4. the block does not straddle a landcover-class boundary, when one is
 *      given - see `coverClasses`.
 *
 * Condition 2 is what keeps every boundary crisp: any block containing a
 * region transition is refused, so a boundary block always bottoms out at
 * `minLeafSize` and gets handed to the marching-squares cutter at that scale
 * - `cutCell` for the ordinary two-region case, `cutCellRegions` wherever
 * three or four regions meet in one cell (a landuse edge crossing the coast,
 * for instance). Condition 4 is a coarser-grained backstop for a boundary
 * that exists only in the raster `.plc` cover and was never resolved into
 * real region geometry: refusing the merge is enough there; nothing needs to
 * know *where* through the block that boundary runs, since it never feeds
 * `Leaf.uniform` and is never handed to either cutter.
 *
 * The tree is then *balanced* so neighbouring leaves differ by at most one
 * level. That bounds T-junctions to a single midpoint per edge, which the
 * triangulation absorbs by fanning the leaf from its centre through a ring that
 * includes the midpoint wherever the neighbour is finer. Nothing is finer than
 * `minLeafSize`, so a boundary leaf never needs a midpoint of its own and the
 * cutter's output can be used verbatim.
 *
 * Everything here works in grid coordinates: x east, y south, matching the
 * row-major DEM layout with v=0 at the north edge.
