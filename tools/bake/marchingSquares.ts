/**
 * Marching-squares cell cutting: split one grid cell into land and water
 * triangles along the shoreline.
 *
 * This replaces the constrained Delaunay triangulation the old runtime used.
 * Working one cell at a time makes the problem local and finite: there are 16
 * corner classifications, each with a known decomposition, so there is no
 * global solver, no sliver backstop heuristic, and no failure mode that needs
 * a whole-tile fallback.
 *
 * Corner and edge numbering, in cell-local coordinates where x runs east and
 * y runs south (matching the row-major DEM grid, v=0 at the north edge):
 *
 *      c0 (0,0) ---- e0 ---- c1 (1,0)
 *          |                    |
 *         e3                   e1
 *          |                    |
 *      c3 (0,1) ---- e2 ---- c2 (1,1)
 *
 * `edgeCrossings[i]` is where the shoreline crosses the edge leaving corner i,
 * as a parameter in [0, 1] along that edge. It is required whenever the two
 * corners of that edge differ in class, and ignored otherwise.
 *
 * Slivers are eliminated by construction rather than detected afterwards: a
 * crossing within `SNAP_EPS` of either end is snapped onto that corner, which
 * collapses the offending triangle to zero area so it is dropped.
 */

/**
 * A cell-local point. `shore` marks the ones that came from a shoreline
 * crossing rather than a cell corner.
 *
 * Land and water become separate meshes downstream, and they have to agree on
 * height exactly where they meet or the seam opens. Tagging the crossings here
 * is what lets the projection recognise them. Matching land against water
 * positions numerically instead is fragile: adjacent leaves compute the same
 * crossing independently and can disagree in the last decimal.
