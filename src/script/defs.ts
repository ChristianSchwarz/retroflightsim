 * Half-extent of the playable world in ENU metres.

 * This replaces the old TERRAIN_SCALE * TERRAIN_MODEL_SIZE product, which
 * defined a +/-50 km *toroidal wrap*: fly past the edge and the aircraft
 * teleported to the opposite side while the terrain did not follow. That was
 * a leftover from the 5x5 map.gltf mosaic and made no sense on a geographic
 * DEM. The baked Canary coverage spans roughly 600 x 390 km, so 350 km from
 * the play origin comfortably contains it; beyond the data the terrain is
 * open ocean, and the aircraft is clamped rather than teleported.
