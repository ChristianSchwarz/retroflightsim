 * top-to-bottom gradient and nothing else: one colour for the whole ring of the
 * horizon, whichever way you faced. Half of what the scattering model computes
 * is directional - the sky opposite a setting sun stays deep blue while the sky
 * around it burns orange, and the Mie forward lobe piles a washed-out halo onto
 * the solar side - and none of that could reach the screen through a single
 * uniform. A dome can carry it, one vertex at a time.
 *
 * The dome is drawn in the background-sky pass, where the camera sits at the
 * origin and copies only the main camera's rotation, so its radius is arbitrary
 * and it never parallaxes. Colours are baked into a vertex attribute whenever
 * the sun moves rather than evaluated per pixel: the scattering model is CPU
 * code, and a few hundred vertices is the right granularity for a sky that
