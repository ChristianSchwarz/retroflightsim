 *
 * Centripetal rather than uniform, because the node spacing here is not
 * remotely even — a few metres round a curve against a hundred down a
 * straight — and uniform Catmull-Rom cusps and self-intersects on exactly
 * that input.
 *
 * Guarded three ways, because a spline through every node is wrong for
 * pavement — this is a surveyed surface, not a curve through some points, and
 * every metre it wanders is a metre of taxiway on ground nobody paved:
 *
 *  - A node that is not a real bend keeps a chord tangent, which collapses the
 *    cubic through it to the straight line it replaced. So a straight run
 *    noded every hundred metres, each node out by a fraction of a degree,
 *    comes back exactly as it went in ({@link SMOOTH_MIN_TURN_RAD}).
 *  - A bend is rounded over a fixed reach either side and no further, so the
 *    cost of a bend does not grow with the legs that meet at it
 *    ({@link SMOOTH_REACH_WIDTHS}).
 *  - A span that still leaves its chord by more than half the taxiway's width
 *    is dropped back to that chord. Nothing measured across the baked fields
 *    trips this — the worst departure anywhere is 2.4 m on a 23 m taxiway —
 *    which is the point: it is the backstop that makes the bound a bound.
 *
 * Subdivision follows the departure it measures, so a span already within
 * {@link SMOOTH_SAG_M} of its chord — which is 96% of them, given how finely
 * a curve is noded — emits its endpoint and no more.
 *
 * Note what this does not do. A Catmull-Rom passes *through* every node, so it
 * eases a bend by spreading the turn either side of it; it cannot cut the
 * corner off, which is what a real fillet does. That leaves a slight
 * counter-bow on the approach, under a metre. Cutting corners properly wants
 * an approximating curve — a quadratic Bezier across the two cut points, with
