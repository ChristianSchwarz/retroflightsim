/**
 * Tile streaming: the quadtree declares what it wants, this owns everything
 * else — scoring, cancellation, predictive prefetch and the frame budget.
 *
 * Each reconcile pass produces a *want set*. `setWants` diffs it against what
 * is resident, in flight and queued: newly wanted tiles are enqueued,
 * no-longer-wanted fetches are aborted, and everything still wanted is
 * re-scored. Nothing ever carries a stale priority.
 *
 * The priority function is the whole policy:
 *
 *   priority = (pinned         ? 1e9 : 0)   boot / play-area seeding
 *            + (inFrustum      ? 1e6 : 0)   visible beats speculative
 *            + (parentResident ? 0 : 5e5)   coarse-to-fine, always
 *            + sse / (1 + distanceKm)
 *
 * The `parentResident` term is what guarantees we never block on a deep tile
 * while an ancestor is missing, so coarse-to-fine falls out of the scoring
 * rather than needing separate machinery. It pairs with the quadtree's "a
 * parent stays drawn until all four children are resident" rule: that one
 * prevents holes, this one makes them short.
