/**
 * Binds a decoded PTM1 tile to GPU buffers.
 *
 * This is the payoff for the format's layout: nothing here copies or
 * transforms vertex data. Quantised int16 positions are bound directly and
 * turned into metres by the mesh's scale; int8 normals are bound normalized
 * through an interleaved view that skips their pad byte. A tile goes from
 * bytes to drawable without touching a single vertex on the CPU, which is why
 * the runtime needs no mesh workers at all.
 *
 * Up to three meshes come out per tile — land, water and watercourse strokes —
 * because the streams have different vertex layouts. Water carries one draw
 * group per tone; land is a single group whose colour the shader resolves per
 * vertex from the baked cover attribute. The strokes are a centreline the
 * vertex program widens, so they need their own material as well as their own
 * attributes, and they are the one stream drawn after the surface rather than
 * as part of it.
 *
 * Tiles are placed by translation only, never rotation. The shaded vertex
 * program treats the normal attribute as world-space in the STATIC and DUOTONE
 * shading paths, so a rotated tile would shade wrong; the bake writes both
 * positions and normals in scene axes (x=east, y=up, z=south) for exactly this
 * reason. See `sceneFromEnu` for why z runs south.
