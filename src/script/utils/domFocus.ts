/**
 * Is the keyboard currently being used to type, rather than to fly?
 *
 * The game binds its shortcuts on `document`, and nothing in `src/` looks at
 * `document.activeElement` — so typing a name into the F9 area picker's field
 * today toggles the flight recorder on `r`, force vectors on `v` and the
 * barricade on `k`, and switches cameras on F1/F2/F3. That was survivable while
 * the only text field in the app was one you used for a moment; an editor with
 * a properties panel makes it constant.
 *
 * Kept in `utils` rather than in a panel because all four handlers that need it
 * live in three different files, and the fix only works if they all agree.
