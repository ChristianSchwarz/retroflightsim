/**
 * `facetColor()` from the terrain vertex shader, on the CPU.
 *
 * The plan view is a chart of the world the player flies, so it has to be
 * painted the way the world is painted — the same landcover class, the same
 * satellite colour, the same palette tones, the same four modes. The data is
 * all there in the baked mesh; only the resolution of it lived in GLSL.
 *
 * This is a deliberate duplication of
 * [terrainVP.ts](../scene/materials/shaders/terrainVP.ts), and the risk that
 * comes with it is drift: change the shader and this silently keeps painting
 * the old colours. Two things hold them together — the inputs are the same
 * uniforms rather than a parallel set of constants, and
 * `facetColour.test.ts` pins each mode's behaviour against the same worked
 * examples the shader implements. The alternative was pointing a second camera
 * at the terrain mesh, which needs a projection refactor of the renderer's
 * hottest path and shares the mesh cache, so panning the map would evict
 * terrain from under the aircraft.
 *
 * Lighting is deliberately NOT applied. The shader multiplies by `uRawLight`,
 * which is a time-of-day term; a chart authored at midnight would otherwise be
 * black. This returns the unlit colour — what the facet *is*, not how it looks
 * at this hour.
