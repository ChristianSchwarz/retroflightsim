/**
 * Hard ceiling on the aircraft a mission may put in the sim, split by faction
 * because it is a pool of pre-built entities, not an allocation.
 *
 * `encodeSnapshotInto` builds its id list from `this.order` with NO `enabled`
 * filter, and throws `aircraft count N exceeds shared bank` above
 * `SIM_SHARED_MAX_AIRCRAFT`. The throw lands inside the worker's step handler,
 * comes back as `{type:'error'}`, and the sim then stalls with `busy` cleared
 * and no state published — a frozen sim, not a visible exception. 'player',
 * 'wing0' and 'ai0' already hold three of those rows, so a mission gets 13.
 *
 * Enforced in three places on purpose: here in the validator, again in
 * `missionResolve`, and again at pool assignment. `missionFormat.test.ts`
 * asserts the arithmetic against the real `SIM_SHARED_MAX_AIRCRAFT` so that a
 * future entity added anywhere fails at the source instead of here.
 *
 * The bank, not the CPU, is what bounds this. Measured on a full bank of routed
 * AI aircraft, `CombatSim.step` costs 0.099 ms mean / 0.168 ms p95 at 16 against
 * 0.041 ms at 3 — roughly linear, and about 170x under the 20 ms the client
 * warns at; `encodeSnapshotInto` is another 0.02 ms. So raising the ceiling is a
 * question about the terrain mirror's tile budget and about `postMessage` on the
 * non-SharedArrayBuffer path, never about pilot or physics cost.
 *
 * `AiAircraftEntity.faction` is `readonly` and the sim protocol has no
 * `setFaction`, so a flight is assigned from the sub-pool that already matches
 * its faction. Exceeding either sub-pool is an ERROR, not a clamp: silently
 * dropping half a mission's opposition is worse than refusing to fly it.
